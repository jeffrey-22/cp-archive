# CP Archive

Archive for my competitive programming stuff, so that I can pretend that I do a lot of coding

Expect some horrible unreadable C++ code mixed in with all the dirty files

Compile most of them with ```g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -lm -static -o "$1" "$1.cpp"```

```GYM <number>``` means the contest at ```codeforces.com/gym/<number>```
